# ST558_Project3

This is a repo containing work from project3 for ST558.

• a list of R packages used
• the code used to create the analyses from a single .Rmd file (i.e. the render() code)
• links to .html files of the generated analyses (which will be created by github pages! Not you!) 
For example,
– Analysis for [work.md](work.html). 
Note you should only have a college_graduate_analysis.md file in the repo - github pages will render the .html file for you
