# Introduction

Diabetes is a seriously pervasive chronic disease that disrupts the body’s ability to regulate blood glucose levels, leading to a diminished quality of life and reduced life expectancy. It stands as one of the most prevalent chronic illnesses in the United States, impacting millions of Americans annually and imposing a significant economic burden on the nation.  

In this project, we will use the `diabetes binary health indicators` dataset obtained from [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/) to conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and develop predictive models. This dataset comprises 253,680 survey responses to the CDC’s BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) from year 2015. The primary target variable, `Diabetes_binary`, offers binary classification, distinguishing between 0 for no diabetes, and 1 for prediabetes or diabetes. This dataset encompasses 21 feature variables and is not balanced. Detailed information of variable can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/?select=diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv).  

Our analysis will primarily focus on a subset of key variables, including High blood pressure (HighBP), High cholesterol (HighChol), cholesterol check (CholCheck), Body Mass Index (BMI), Smoker, Fruits, Veggies, and Age.  
In our EDA phase, we will start by summarizing basic statistics visualizing variable frequencies. This will be followed by the exploration of correlations between variables and the creation of contingency tables to better understand the interplay of these factors.  

Based on the results from EDA, we will split the dataset into training (70%) and test (30%) subsets for each educational level. Subsequently, we will employ the training data to fit six distinct models, including a logistic regression, a LASSO logistic regression, a classification tree model, a random forest model, a xx model, as well as a xxx model. The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using the test dataset, and we will determine the most effective model for predicting diabetes outcomes.

# Data
## Read in data
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
diabetes <- as_tibble(read.csv("diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv", header = TRUE))
head(diabetes)
```
# grouping Education levels
```{r}
diabetes$Education <- ifelse(diabetes$Education %in% c(1, 2), "SomeElementary",
                         ifelse(diabetes$Education == 3, "SomeHighSchool", 
                              ifelse(diabetes$Education == 4, "HighSchool",
                                   ifelse(diabetes$Education == 5, "SomeCollege",
                                        ifelse(diabetes$Education == 6, "College", NA)))))

params$Edu
```

## Subsetting the dataset based on education level
```{r}
EducationData <- filter(diabetes, (Education == params$Edu))
```

## EDA
### Checking the missing values
```{r}
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(EducationData))
```

### Summary statistics for numeric variables
```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Filter only numeric variables
numeric_vars <- EducationData %>% select_if(is.numeric)
# Create a summary table
summary_table <- numeric_vars %>%
  sapply(function(x) {
    c( count = sum(!is.na(x)),
      mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      std = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      min = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      Q1 = quantile(x, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),
      median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE),
      Q3 = quantile(x, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE),
      max = max(x, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  })
# Transpose the summary table
transposed_summary_table <- t(round(summary_table, 2)) 
colnames(transposed_summary_table) <- c("count", "mean", "std", 
                                        "min", "Q1", "median", "Q3", "max")
# Print the transposed table
print(transposed_summary_table)
```
The center and spread of each variable can be found in this table.

### Check the correlation between Diabetes_binary and the other variables
```{r}
library(knitr)
# Create a correlation matrix between variables
Cor_Matrix <- EducationData %>% 
         select(Diabetes_binary, BMI, MentHlth, PhysHlth, Age, Income) %>%
         cor()

# Round the correlation matrix to two decimal places
rounded_Cor_Matrix <- round(Cor_Matrix, digits = 2)
# Print the rounded correlation matrix
kable(rounded_Cor_Matrix)
```

### Visualization of correlation with `Diabetes_binary` through bar graph
```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
# Exclude the character variable from the data
data <- EducationData[, !(names(EducationData) %in% "Education")]

# Calculate the correlation of each variable with 'Diabetes_binary'
correlations <- sapply(data[-1], function(x) cor(x, data$Diabetes_binary))

# Create a data frame for the correlations
correlation_data <- data.frame(Variable = names(correlations), Correlation = correlations)

# Create a bar chart of correlations
ggplot(correlation_data, aes(x = Variable, y = Correlation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Correlation with Diabetes_binary", x = "Variable", y = "Correlation") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
  # coord_flip()  # Rotate the x-axis labels for better readability
```
n this chart, some of the variables exhibited positive correlations with 'Diabetes_binary,' while others showed negative correlations with it.
